# Bibliotek

Bibliotek is an open-source online library created with public domain books for students to access. It also contains an online PDF reader with markers. 

The project was built with Flask, Swagger for documentation and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend.


The project was created by Claudia Rodrigues in her second trimester at the Software Engineering Post Graduate Course at PUC-Rio.
